# Material_Sorter
It will sort material based on certain properties into different storage boxes. In my case i did it based on magnetic properties.

First of all get all the required parts:

You can get all the material for the above using the following links:

2 x Dc Motor --> https://a.co/d/hThEPPq

1 x L298 Motor Driver --> https://a.co/d/6bdZdHH

1 x Arduino Uno --> https://a.co/d/2X68hMl

1 x 12v rechargable battery --> https://www.amazon.in/Lithium-Rechargeable-Battery-Industrial-Equipment/dp/B085BGY3NV/ref=sr_1_6?keywords=12%2Bv%2Bbattery&sr=8-6&th=1

As per need x Jumper wires --> https://a.co/d/9OpCN2D

1 x Hall Effect Sensor --> https://www.amazon.in/xcluma-sensor-Speed-Counting-Module/dp/B098QWW58Q/ref=sr_1_19?keywords=hall+effect+sensor&sr=8-19

1 x IR Sensor --> https://a.co/d/a8pLr5r

Now you will have to make a DIY model of a conveyor belt with a moving channel in the front.

for reference the setip should look something like this:

After that the connections for it can be done as shown in the schematics below:

Now for the coding part i will provide the code below for the functioning:


you can download the code using the given link and put it in your arduino:[Magnetic sorter.docx](https://github.com/PandaMunda/Material_Sorter/files/12643340/Magnetic.sorter.docx)

Congratulations you have built your own Sorting bot using arduino uno.

After attatching the battery mine was working completely fine as you can see in the video:

As you can see that the robot was properly sorting the materials in the video it let the cardbaord piece go straight and sent the magnet(wrapped in paper for testing purposes) in other direction.

If you have any complications with the same you can try asking it in the queries section i will be there to help asap.
